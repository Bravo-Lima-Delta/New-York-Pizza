    "text": "Seriously! Who doesn’t like New York Pizza!\nNew York is famous for lots of things: The Statue of Liberty, Central Park, Wall Street, skyscrapers, congestion, nightlife, and cheesy Tom Hanks rom-coms. But, it also gets praised for its cheesy pizza! And boy is it gooooood! So good, in fact, it leaves many people wondering: “What is the best pizza in New York? If I go there, which pizza should I try first?”\nDon’t worry. We’ve got you covered.\n\n\nManhattan pizza reviews\nInternet celebrity and pizza critic Dave Portnoy and his pizza-rating community have rated hundreds pizza joints across Manhattan on a scale of 0-10 (10 being the best and 0 being the worst). We’ve gained access to a data set that allows us to see their pizza ratings and create a short list of where to stop in for an awesome slice without leaving disappointed. After all, who wants to enter the grumbling chaos of the city just to get even more ticked off with bad pizza!\n\n\n“But hold the rats. And no bugs either, please!”\nHonestly, though, if you’re just looking for Dave’s ratings, we could have pointed to you to his OneBite pizza app. This will get you what you need if you’re just looking for good pizza in Manhattan. But the problem remains: your pizza might taste good, but is it nasty? How has your pizza been made? What standards are the pizza makers upholding when it comes to the sanitary conditions of their restaurant?\nDave’s ratings don’t provide any transparency into the pizza production environment. Our analysis, on the other hand, couples Dave’s review data with New York Health Department inspection results to get you to good, safe pizza quickly.\nBelieve us; the best pizza is is safe pizza. Especially when it’s been kept from rats, mice, roaches, and flies. Gross.\n\n\nYou can’t go wrong with the best! But…if you insist…\nHere’s an dashboard we’ve built that will get you to the best, SAFE pizza in Manhattan. However, if you just care about taste and don’t care about NASTY sanitary conditions, we’ve allowed for that option, too.\nToggle between ‘Safe Pizza’ and ‘Nasty Pizza’ to navigate between result sets. Hover and click to isolate places of interest and to get review stats, address, and contact info.\n\n\n\n\nThe broader imperative\nWe get it. It’s just pizza. And it’s New York. Can we really expect the health conditions of the busiest pizza restaurants in the world to be perfect? Like, will New York ever be able to purge itself of unsanitary pests that might get into the food or ingredients you’re served?\nMaybe not. But if you stop and think about it, if a restaurant is working hard to ensure a clean, sanitary environment, don’t you think they’re also putting in the extra effort to make great-tasting pizza? Let’s reward the businesses that are ensuring our safety and enjoy a the taste of New York the way it was meant to be experienced!\nCheers,\nBrian Davidhizar"

    "text": "Sources\nThe underlying data of this report was sourced from two datasets:\n\nDAVE_PORTNOY_PIZZA_REVIEW_DATA (available here as a .csv – ~1.1MB)\nThis data set is a pizza slice review data set from Dave Portnoy who reviews pizza locations primarily in New York. This data set includes a lot of information, but it includes the Yelp Rating of the restaurant at the time of the review, as well as Dave’s score of the pizza he ate.\nNYC_HEALTH_INSPECTION_DATA (available here as a .xlsx – ~37.4MB)\nThis data set provides every public health inspection result for all the restaurants in NYC.\n\n\n\nData Preparation and Transformation\nIn order to get the data into final form for dashboard & report production, we used the joining/noodling functionality provided by Tableau Public to join/relate the two data sets together.\nFor expediency, we joined the two sets together using phone number as the unique identifier.\nWhile it’s possible that the combined data set could be expanded to include more establishments by means of a more thorough cleaning of the data and then by joining on other certain attributes, we felt that the 100+ pizza establishments produced by our joining methodology presents itself as a data set broad enough to build a useful product/analysis for the end-consumer."
